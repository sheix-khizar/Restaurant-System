# Restaurant-System
The Restaurant Management System in C++ allows customers to place orders, view their total bill, and interact with a menu. Admins can manage menu items (add, remove, update) and store data in files for persistence. It provides a simple, efficient interface for both customers and admins, with default menu items included.
